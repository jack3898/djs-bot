# The web client!

This is the web client for the project written in React, TypeScript, Vite and TailwindCSS.

## Component library

This client uses [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/). It works quite differently from other component libraries, so make sure to read the documentation.

## CLI

Use `npm run shadci-ui <command>` to interact with the component library _at the root of the monorepo (no`cd`!)_. Their documentation is available [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

You may need to amend the generated files to fit the project's structure but the changes should be minimal.
