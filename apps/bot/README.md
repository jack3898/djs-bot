# Bot

This is the main bot application!

## Setup

1. Rename .envexample to .env
2. Insert your bot token in .env
3. Make sure you are at the root of the whole project, not this bot folder
4. Assuming the repo is installed following the instructions in the root README, run `npm run start` to start the bot or `npm run dev` to start the bot in development mode.
